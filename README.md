# SuperheroApp

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your API key (see `.env.example`)

3. Start the app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Notes
 - The official SuperHero image host blocks direct image loading from mobile apps.
 - Because of that, hero images may not load correctly on some devices.
 - In the app I use placeholder images as a fallback.
 - If the images are not blocked in your environment, you should see the real hero images instead of placeholders.
